        <h3>What can we do?</h3>
        <p id="txt">In the beggining of this Pandemic, the staff at Sandvika Science Museum ask ourselves
          "What could we do?". We all elaborated and we came to the conclusion that our task will not change 
          form what we usually do. As educators we still look at our task of informing the public with correct and
          scientific based information as a key role in the fight against COVID-19. This is why we hold online Exhibitions
          to reach our audiance and continue our quest for knowledge.
